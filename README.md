I created a number, a string, a list, and a dictionary. Then I created a function which takes two varibales of blood pressures. The function checks the input values to determine blood preseeure. If the inputs are less than 120 and 80 I expect a normal blood pressure to be printed. If the inputs are higher than 120 and 80 I expect it to print high blood pressure.
